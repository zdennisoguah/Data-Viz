# About 
The data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset?select=Tableau+Full+Project.xlsx)

This data is a part of the Airbnb Inside initiative and describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle. The data contains three different CSV files each about,

Information about the listings,
Reviews for each listing,
A Calendar file, containing the price and availability of a listing for each day over the span of a year.
It is straightforward to understand the data as most of it is straightforward, and we can make good use of the visualizations provided by Airbnb, at this [link](http://insideairbnb.com/seattle/).

After looking at the visualizations provided by Airbnb, A few questions were raised in my mind which I had to explore using the dataset. Those are,

What is the average price per area?
How does the price vary with an increase in the number of bedrooms?
Which listing generates the most income by bedrooms?
